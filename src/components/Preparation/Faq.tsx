          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          className="underline font-bold"

        Then go to Next Step.
        <br/>
        Select <strong>"Send Download link via email"</strong>, Set freqquency to <strong>"Export Once"</strong> and File type to <strong>.zip</strong>. You can keep file size as <strong>2GB</strong>.

        Once your data export is ready, you will receive an email - often this
        only takes a few minutes. After your export is done you can download the
        file from Gmail. You'll need to upload this file to Wrapped for
        Google Maps.

        Wrapped for Google Maps is not-safe and invades privacy ofc. If you know how to
